##Description

The code review for this week is a programming test that makes sure you understand how to use loops, conditionals, and variables.

The challenge is to simply make a web page where the user is prompted to enter a number, and then the page displays every number up to that number. But, for multiples of three, the page prints "ping" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, the page prints "pong". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, the page prints "ping-pong".
